> **NOTE:**  
> To increase flexibility when managing a large volume of Resources, Role Grants have
been deprecated in favor of Access Rules, which allow you to grant access based
on Resource tags and type.
>
> Previously, you would grant a Role access to specific resources by ID via Role
Grants. Now, when using Access Rules, the best practice is to grant Resources access based on type and tags.
>
>The following examples demonstrate Dynamic Access Rules with tags and Resource types, as well as Static Access Rules. If it is _necessary_ to grant access to specific Resources in the same way as RoleGrants did, you can use Resource IDs directly in Access Rules.
